# 🏁 Pit Stop Timing Optimizer

A beginner Python project to calculate how much race time was spent in pit stops — perfect for Formula 1 or racing game fans!

## 📌 Project Description

This is a simple CLI-based (Command Line Interface) Python script where:
- You enter the total race time in seconds
- You enter how many pit stops were made
- You enter the average duration of each pit stop in seconds

The script calculates:
- Total pit stop time
- Percentage of race time spent in the pits
- Displays a warning if the pit time is more than 5% of the total race

## 💡 Example

```
Enter the total race time in seconds: 5400
Enter how many pit stops were made: 3
Enter the average pit stop duration in seconds: 30

Total pit stop time: 90 seconds
Percentage of race spent in pits: 1.67%
```

## ⚠️ Special Feature

If the pit time is more than **5%** of the race time, you'll see this message:

```
You need a new pit crew. 🛠️
```

## 🧠 What You Learn

✅ Taking user input  
✅ Type conversion (`int`)  
✅ Basic math and percentages  
✅ Conditional logic (`if`)  
✅ Printing formatted output

## 📦 Requirements

No external libraries are needed. Just Python (version 3.x).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script using a terminal or any Python IDE:
   ```
   python pit_stop_optimizer.py
   ```

## 🌱 Future Improvements (Optional)

- Add individual pit stop durations instead of average
- Add error handling for wrong inputs
- Turn it into a Streamlit web app
- Add visual graphs with `matplotlib`

## 👶 Built With

- Python 3.x
- Your passion to learn 🧠
